# Trail of Hearts
This turns your mouse cursor into a CSS Heart which leaves fading imprints of itself all over the screen.

How it works:
1. Hide the mouse crsor
2. Replace it with a CSS heart at the *x* and *y* co-ordinates of the invisible mouse cursor
  - This should happen every time the mouse moves.
  - The CSS heart is animated and "beating", for added effect.
3. At a certain interval, delete those hearts.
